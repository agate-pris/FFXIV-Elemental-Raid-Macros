# Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)

Elemental's DSR PF strat can be broken down as follows:

- [**Ser Adelphel + Grinnaux**](en/01_adelphel_and_grinnaux.md): HMRT
- [**King Thordan**](en/02_thordan.md): DRK-relative, role adjust
- [**Nidhogg**](en/03_nidhogg.md): Easthogg
- [**Eyes**](en/04_eyes.md): T/H red, DPS blue
- [**Alternate Timeline Thordan**](en/05_alternate_thordan.md): 2-2 Dooms North, Anchored Dooms
- [**Double Dragons**](en/06_double_dragons.md): △, DTTMR, Fixed WB2 *or* 5-1 WB2s
- [**Dragonking Thordan**](en/07_dragonking_thordan.md): All 3-3-2

### BiS Notes

- Dragonsong's Reprise is the current Ultimate, and is **not** outgeared yet.
    - BiS will be a mix of i600 gear, and i605 gear from Lapis Manalis.

Looking towards the future:

- Dragonsong's Reprise will not be outgeared until **i730** gear is available.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **269**.

# Ser Adelphel and Ser Grinnaux

Dragonsong's Reprise is the first Ultimate to showcase a "door" boss. As such, there are two sets of markers and macros to use for this fight.

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the marker order for Hyperdimensional Slash (some groups do N→S).
- Check the Playstation positions (there are many variants).

## English
```
{% include_relative macros/dsr_1.en.txt %}
```

## Markers

All markers are used to bait Hyperdimensional Slashes (black orbs).

# King Thordan

This is the macro for the bulk of the fight.

## English
```
{% include_relative macros/dsr_2.en.txt %}
```

## Markers

If you are doing the fixed Wyrmsbreath 2 strat, I recommend you use the "outer" markers as the tanks can use the intercardinal markers for reference on where to stand.

```json
{
  "Name":"Dragonsong's Reprise (Outer)",
  "MapID":788,
  "A":{"X":100.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":79.0,"ID":0,"Active":true},
  "B":{"X":121.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":100.0,"ID":1,"Active":true},
  "C":{"X":100.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":121.0,"ID":2,"Active":true},

  "One":{"X":114.849,"Y":0.0,"Z":85.151,"ID":4,"Active":true},
  "Two":{"X":114.849,"Y":0.0,"Z":114.849,"ID":5,"Active":true},
  "Three":{"X":85.151,"Y":0.0,"Z":114.849,"ID":6,"Active":true},
  "Four":{"X":85.151,"Y":0.0,"Z":85.151,"ID":7,"Active":true}
}
```

</details>

Otherwise, the "inner" markers are also popular.

The intercardinal markers demarcate:

- The boundaries for the charges at the start of Strength of the Ward
- Where to stand to bait the towers in Nidhogg
- The boundary of Hot Tail in the Double Dragons phase.
